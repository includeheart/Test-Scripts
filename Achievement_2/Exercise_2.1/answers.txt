1. Django is popular because it’s a high-level Python framework that follows the “batteries-included” philosophy, offering built-in tools for security, authentication, ORM, and admin dashboards. It enables developers to build scalable, secure, and maintainable applications quickly without reinventing the wheel. Its strong community support and extensive documentation also make it a go-to choice.
